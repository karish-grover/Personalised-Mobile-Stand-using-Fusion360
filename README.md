This vidoe details the steps for the creation of a laptop stand. Once you understand the idea of using parameters, constraints, dimension specifications, etc. apply these skills to create a mobile phone stand with the following specs.

**Mandatory Requirements**
- The dimensions of the stand should not be more than L=phone portrait mode length + 20mm, W=phone portrait mode width + 20mm, H = 60mm.
- The construction should be formed out of panels that can be laser cut and glued together like in the reference video.
- The thickness should be based on the material of choice. 
- Set the appearance to the appropriate material.
- Your name and phone model should be engraved in a visible location on the design.
- There should not be a sharp edge anywhere on the design.
